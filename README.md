# Path Following and Obstacle Avoidance using Pure Pursuit and VFH

## üìå Overview
This project implements a hybrid navigation controller for mobile robots by combining **Pure Pursuit path tracking** with **Vector Field Histogram (VFH) obstacle avoidance**. The system was modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and validated for waypoint tracking and obstacle-rich environments.

## ‚ö° Objectives
- Develop a controller that integrates Pure Pursuit with VFH for safe navigation.
- Implement curvature-based trajectory generation and histogram-based obstacle avoidance.
- Tune parameters (lookahead distance, valley width) for improved accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
- **Path Following:** Pure Pursuit algorithm for smooth trajectory tracking.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** VFH for real-time collision-free navigation.
- **Integration:** Hybrid control combining both modules in MATLAB/Simulink.

## üìä Results
- Achieved **smooth waypoint tracking** with dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- Reduced overshoot near waypoints by parameter tuning.
- Demonstrated robustness in narrow corridor scenarios.
- The Results and code are attached in the report which has been uploaded in the repository.
